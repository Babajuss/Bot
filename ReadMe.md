You can obtain your API credentials from your [Telegram account](https://my.telegram.org/apps).

1. **Authentication:** Provide your Telegram API ID, API hash, and phone number.
2. **Chat Selection:** List and select chats for forwarding messages.
3. **Keyword Setup:** Specify keywords that will trigger the forwarding action.
