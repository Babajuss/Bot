## üõ†Ô∏è How it Works

The Soluify Bot harnesses the power of the [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) library to interact with the Telegram API. Once you set up the bot with your Telegram API credentials, you can list all your chats and pinpoint those you want to forward messages from. If you don't have your API credentials yet, you can grab them from your [Telegram account](https://my.telegram.org/apps).

1. **Authentication:** Provide your Telegram API ID, API hash, and phone number.
2. **Chat Selection:** List and select the chats you want to monitor for forwarding messages.
3. **Extra Configuration:** Specify keywords, add signatures, and more.
