## üåü Features

- **Keyword-Based Forwarding:** Automatically forward messages containing specific keywords between chats.
- **Multiple Source Chats:** Copy from more than one source location.

## üõ†Ô∏è How it Works

The script leverages the [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) library to interact with the Telegram API. After providing your Telegram API ID, API hash, and phone number for authentication, you can list all your chats and select those for message forwarding. You can obtain your API details from you [telegram account](https://my.telegram.org/apps). The script then monitors the specified source chat and forwards messages containing any of the specified keywords to the destination chat.

## üîë Keywords

Specify one or more keywords that, if found in a message, will trigger the forwarding process. Keywords are case-insensitive and can be set up during the initial configuration.

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Signatures

Add a signature in bold to the end of every message that gets forwarded by the script.
